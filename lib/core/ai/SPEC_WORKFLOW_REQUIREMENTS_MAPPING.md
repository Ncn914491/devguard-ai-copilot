# Natural Language Specification Workflow - Requirements Mapping

This document maps the implemented natural language specification workflow components to the specific requirements they satisfy.

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 1.1: Natural Language Specification Processing
**Implementation:** `GeminiService.processSpecification()` and `SpecService.processSpecification()`
- **GeminiService**: Converts natural language input into structured git actions using AI processing
- **Mock Implementation**: Provides intelligent keyword-based processing for demo purposes
- **Context Awareness**: Analyzes input for security, UI, database, and API keywords to provide appropriate suggestions
- **Structured Output**: Returns `SpecificationResult` with interpretation, branch name, commit message, and metadata

### Requirement 1.2: Structured Git Commit Generation
**Implementation:** `GeminiService._mockProcessSpecification()` and `SpecificationResult` class
- **Branch Naming**: Generates kebab-case branch names following git conventions (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`)
- **Commit Messages**: Creates conventional commit format messages (e.g., `feat: implement user authentication`)
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Different patterns for security, UI, database, and API specifications
- **Validation**: Ensures proper git naming conventions and descriptive messages

### Requirement 1.3: Pull Request Creation with Documentation
**Implementation:** `Specification.placeholderDiff` field and `SpecService`
- **Placeholder Diff**: Generates text descriptions of expected code changes
- **Documentation Context**: Includes implementation details, testing requirements, and integration notes
- **PR Draft Generation**: Creates structured content for pull request descriptions
- **Change Tracking**: Links specifications to git commits for complete traceability

### Requirement 1.4: Git Change Tracking and Auditability
**Implementation:** `AuditLogService` integration throughout `SpecService`
- **Complete Tracking**: Every specification action logged in audit trail
- **Git Integration**: Specifications linked to commit hashes and branch names
- **Status Tracking**: Full workflow status from draft → approved → in_progress → completed
- **Change History**: All modifications tracked with timestamps and user context

### Requirement 1.5: Ambiguity Detection and Clarification
**Implementation:** `SpecService.validateSpecification()` and `ValidationResult` class
- **Ambiguous Term Detection**: Identifies vague terms like "it", "this", "something"
- **Completeness Validation**: Checks for minimum input length and technical context
- **Clarification Requests**: Provides specific suggestions for improving specifications
- **User Feedback**: Returns validation issues and improvement suggestions before processing

### Requirement 9.1: AI Action Audit Logging
**Implementation:** Comprehensive audit logging throughout `SpecService`
- **AI Processing Logs**: Every AI interpretation logged with full context and reasoning
- **Action Tracking**: All specification CRUD operations logged with user context
- **Context Preservation**: Complete input, output, and processing metadata stored
- **Transparency**: AI reasoning and decision-making process fully auditable

### Requirement 9.2: Version Control Integration
**Implementation:** `Specification` model and git action generation
- **Git Integration**: All specifications generate structured git actions (branch, commit)
- **Change Tracking**: Specifications linked to git commits and branches
- **Version History**: Complete audit trail of all specification changes
- **Code Traceability**: Direct mapping from natural language input to git actions

### Requirement 9.3: Detailed Explanations and Evidence
**Implementation:** `SpecificationResult.interpretation` and audit logging
- **AI Explanations**: Detailed interpretation of natural language input provided
- **Processing Evidence**: Complete context data stored for each AI decision
- **Reasoning Transparency**: AI reasoning process documented in audit logs
- **Decision Context**: Full input/output context preserved for review

### Requirement 5.2: AI-Suggested Assignments Based on Expertise
**Implementation:** `SpecService._suggestAssignee()` method
- **Skill Matching**: Analyzes required skills from AI processing against team member expertise
- **Workload Balancing**: Considers current workload when suggesting assignments
- **Expertise Analysis**: Matches specification requirements to team member skills
- **Automatic Assignment**: Suggests best-fit team member based on availability and expertise

### Requirement 5.3: Human Approval for Assignments
**Implementation:** `SpecService.approveSpecification()` and audit logging
- **Approval Workflow**: Specifications require explicit human approval before implementation
- **Approval Tracking**: All approvals logged with approver identity and timestamp
- **Status Management**: Clear workflow from draft → approved with human oversight
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of who approved what and when

## Component Architecture

### GeminiService
```dart
class GeminiService {
  // AI processing with fallback to mock implementation
  Future<SpecificationResult> processSpecification(String input);
  
  // Context-aware processing for different specification types
  SpecificationResult _mockProcessSpecification(String input);
}
```

### SpecService
```dart
class SpecService {
  // Main workflow orchestration
  Future<Specification> processSpecification(String input, {String? userId});
  
  // Validation and clarification
  Future<ValidationResult> validateSpecification(String input);
  
  // Approval workflow
  Future<void> approveSpecification(String specId, String approvedBy);
  
  // Assignment suggestions
  Future<String?> _suggestAssignee(SpecificationResult aiResult);
}
```

### UI Components
- **SpecInputForm**: Natural language input with AI processing and preview
- **SpecListView**: Specification management with status tracking
- **WorkflowScreen**: Complete workflow interface with tabbed navigation

## Data Flow

1. **Input Validation**: User input validated for completeness and clarity
2. **AI Processing**: Natural language converted to structured git actions
3. **Specification Creation**: Results stored in database with audit logging
4. **Assignment Suggestion**: AI suggests team member based on expertise
5. **Human Approval**: Specification requires explicit approval before implementation
6. **Status Tracking**: Complete workflow status management
7. **Audit Trail**: Every action logged for complete transparency
