- **AI Agent**: Kiro

## Actions Performed

### 1. Project Structure Creation
- Created Flutter desktop project with proper pubspec.yaml configuration
- Set up dependencies for state management (Provider), navigation (go_router), database (sqflite_common_ffi)
- Configured project for cross-platform desktop development (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### 2. Core Architecture Implementation
- **Database Service**: Implemented SQLite database service with tables for security_alerts, audit_logs, deployments, snapshots, honeytokens, and config_monitoring
- **State Management**: Created ThemeProvider and AppStateProvider using Provider pattern
- **Routing**: Set up go_router with shell routing for main app navigation
- **Theme System**: Implemented comprehensive Material 3 theme with light/dark mode support

### 3. App Shell Components
- **Main Screen**: Created app shell layout with top bar, left sidebar, main canvas, and right sidebar
- **Top Bar**: Implemented with app name, project selector, status indicators, and theme toggle
- **Left Sidebar**: Created collapsible navigation with Home, Security, Deployments, Settings sections
- **Right Sidebar**: Built AI copilot with collapsible/expandable functionality and chat interface

### 4. Screen Implementations
- **Home Screen**: Dashboard with quick stats and recent activity
- **Security Screen**: Security monitoring overview with status cards and alerts section
- **Deployments Screen**: Environment status and deployment history
- **Settings Screen**: Configuration options for appearance, security, and AI copilot

### 5. Development Configuration
- Created analysis_options.yaml with Flutter lints and custom rules
- Set up .gitignore for Flutter desktop development
- Created asset directories for images, icons, and fonts
- Added comprehensive README.md with project documentation

## Requirements Validation

✅ **Requirement 6.1**: Cross-platform desktop interface implemented with Flutter
✅ **Requirement 6.2**: Dark/light theme switching with seamless adaptation

## AI Reasoning
This task established the foundational architecture for the DevGuard AI Copilot application. The implementation prioritizes:

1. **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns with core, presentation, and data layers
2. **Scalability**: Provider-based state management and repository pattern for future expansion
3. **User Experience**: Responsive design with theme support and intuitive navigation
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Flutter desktop implementation targeting Windows, macOS, and Linux

The app shell provides the framework for all subsequent features while ensuring the UI requirements are met from the start. The database schema is designed to support all planned security monitoring, audit logging, and deployment management features.

## Next Steps
Task 2 should focus on implementing the SQLite database foundation and data models to support the security monitoring and audit logging functionality.
