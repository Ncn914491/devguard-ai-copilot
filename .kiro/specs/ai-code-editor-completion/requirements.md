### Requirement 3: Secure Authentication and Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure authentication with multiple options and reliable session management, so that I can safely access the application and maintain my work session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I login with email/password THEN the system SHALL authenticate me securely using JWT tokens
2. WHEN I choose GitHub OAuth THEN the system SHALL integrate with GitHub for streamlined repository access
3. WHEN I forget my password THEN an admin SHALL be able to reset it and provide new secure credentials
4. WHEN my session expires THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh automatically or prompt for re-authentication
5. WHEN I logout THEN the system SHALL properly invalidate my session and clear all authentication tokens

### Requirement 4: WebSocket Real-time Communication

**User Story:** As a team member, I want real-time updates for task assignments, security alerts, and deployment status, so that I can respond quickly to important changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application connects THEN it SHALL establish WebSocket connections for real-time updates
2. WHEN tasks are assigned to me THEN I SHALL receive immediate notifications
3. WHEN security alerts are triggered THEN all relevant team members SHALL be notified instantly
4. WHEN deployments complete or fail THEN the status SHALL update in real-time across all connected clients
5. WHEN team members come online/offline THEN their status SHALL be reflected immediately

### Requirement 5: Task Management with Confidentiality Controls

**User Story:** As a project lead, I want to assign tasks with different confidentiality levels and track progress, so that sensitive work is properly controlled and team productivity is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create tasks THEN I SHALL be able to set confidentiality levels (public, team, restricted, confidential)
2. WHEN I assign tasks THEN only authorized team members SHALL see tasks based on their role and clearance
3. WHEN I view task dashboards THEN I SHALL see progress tracking with deadline monitoring
4. WHEN tasks are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails of all changes
5. WHEN tasks are completed THEN they SHALL trigger appropriate workflow actions (code review, deployment, etc.)

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Role-Specific Dashboards

**User Story:** As a user with a specific role, I want a dashboard tailored to my responsibilities and permissions, so that I can efficiently access the tools and information relevant to my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I log in as an Admin THEN I SHALL see repository management, user management, deployment controls, and system monitoring
2. WHEN I log in as a Lead Developer THEN I SHALL see team task management, code review queues, and deployment oversight
3. WHEN I log in as a Developer THEN I SHALL see my assigned tasks, accessible repositories, and development tools
4. WHEN I log in as a Viewer THEN I SHALL see read-only project overviews and public information
5. WHEN I attempt unauthorized actions THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about required permissions

### Requirement 7: CI/CD Pipeline Integration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want integrated CI/CD pipeline management with automated testing and deployment monitoring, so that I can maintain reliable software delivery.
