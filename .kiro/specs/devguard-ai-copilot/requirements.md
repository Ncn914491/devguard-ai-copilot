# Requirements Document

## Introduction

DevGuard AI Copilot is a cross-platform productivity and security copilot application designed specifically for developers. The application automates git-based workflows, manages deployments with rollback safety, detects suspicious activities including database breaches and compromised system/network behavior, and supports comprehensive team collaboration. The system prioritizes transparency, human oversight, and operates using free resources to ensure accessibility for development teams of all sizes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Natural Language Specification Processing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to provide natural language specifications for features or changes, so that the system can automatically generate structured git commits and pull requests without manual coding overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs a natural language specification THEN the system SHALL parse and convert it into actionable development tasks
2. WHEN specifications are processed THEN the system SHALL generate structured git commits with descriptive commit messages
3. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL create pull requests with proper documentation and context
4. WHEN any AI-driven code generation occurs THEN the system SHALL track all changes in git for complete auditability
5. IF the specification is ambiguous or incomplete THEN the system SHALL request clarification from the user before proceeding

### Requirement 2: Automated Deployment Pipeline Management

**User Story:** As a project lead, I want the system to scaffold and manage CI/CD pipelines from specifications, so that deployments are consistent, automated, and traceable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment specification is provided THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate CI/CD pipeline configurations
2. WHEN pipelines are created THEN the system SHALL include testing, containerization, and deployment stages
3. WHEN deployments are executed THEN the system SHALL create snapshots of the last known good state
4. WHEN deployment failures occur THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest rollback options
5. IF critical deployment actions are requested THEN the system SHALL require human approval before execution

### Requirement 3: Database Security Monitoring

**User Story:** As a security reviewer, I want the system to detect database breaches and suspicious access patterns, so that I can respond quickly to potential security threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL deploy honeytoken records (fake sensitive data) in the database
2. WHEN honeytoken records are accessed THEN the system SHALL immediately trigger security alerts
3. WHEN abnormal query volumes are detected THEN the system SHALL flag potential data export attempts
4. WHEN privilege escalation attempts occur THEN the system SHALL log and alert on the suspicious activity
5. WHEN database anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL provide AI-generated explanations with severity ratings

### Requirement 4: System and Network Anomaly Detection

**User Story:** As a security reviewer, I want to monitor system and network behavior for anomalies, so that I can identify compromised systems or unauthorized access attempts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system files or configurations change unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL detect and report file drift
2. WHEN unusual network connections or port usage occurs THEN the system SHALL flag suspicious network activity
3. WHEN authentication flood attempts are detected THEN the system SHALL trigger security alerts
4. WHEN network connection spikes occur THEN the system SHALL analyze and report on unusual patterns
5. WHEN any system anomaly is detected THEN the system SHALL provide contextual explanations and recommended actions

### Requirement 5: Team Collaboration and Task Management

**User Story:** As a project lead, I want to manage team assignments and track progress through an integrated dashboard, so that I can optimize team productivity and ensure proper task distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the team dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all team members with their roles, active tasks, and status
2. WHEN task assignment is needed THEN the system SHALL provide AI-suggested assignments based on workload and expertise
3. WHEN assignments are made THEN the system SHALL require human approval before finalizing
4. WHEN git issues or tasks are updated THEN the system SHALL sync assignments and track progress automatically
5. IF team members are on bench status THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate their availability for new assignments

### Requirement 6: Intelligent Copilot Assistant

**User Story:** As a developer, I want access to a conversational AI assistant in a sidebar, so that I can get explanations, summaries, and execute quick commands without leaving my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a collapsible right sidebar with the AI copilot
2. WHEN users interact with the copilot THEN it SHALL provide explanations for alerts, summaries of recent changes, and command execution
3. WHEN quick commands are used (/rollback, /assign, /summarize) THEN the system SHALL execute them with appropriate confirmations
4. WHEN the copilot is expanded THEN it SHALL provide a full-screen conversational interface
5. IF the copilot is collapsed THEN it SHALL remain accessible as a small icon for quick access

### Requirement 7: Safe Rollback Mechanism

**User Story:** As a project lead, I want the ability to safely rollback to previous stable states when anomalies are detected, so that I can quickly recover from problematic deployments or security incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployments are made THEN the system SHALL automatically create rollback snapshots
2. WHEN security anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL offer immediate rollback options
3. WHEN rollback is initiated THEN the system SHALL require human confirmation before execution
4. WHEN rollback is completed THEN the system SHALL verify system integrity and report status
5. IF rollback fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative recovery options and detailed error information

### Requirement 8: Cross-Platform User Interface

**User Story:** As a developer using different operating systems, I want a consistent, responsive interface across Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that I can work efficiently regardless of my platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs on any supported platform THEN it SHALL provide identical functionality and appearance
2. WHEN users switch between dark and light modes THEN the interface SHALL adapt seamlessly
3. WHEN the interface is resized THEN all components SHALL respond appropriately to maintain usability
4. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the left sidebar SHALL provide consistent access to all major features
5. IF the application is extended to mobile THEN it SHALL maintain core functionality with appropriate mobile adaptations

### Requirement 9: Transparency and Auditability

**User Story:** As a security reviewer, I want complete visibility into all AI-driven actions and system changes, so that I can audit and verify all automated decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any AI action is performed THEN the system SHALL log the action with full context and reasoning
2. WHEN changes are made to code or configurations THEN the system SHALL track them in version control
3. WHEN security alerts are generated THEN the system SHALL provide detailed explanations and evidence
4. WHEN critical actions are taken THEN the system SHALL require and record human approval
5. IF audit trails are requested THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logs of all activities

### Requirement 10: Resource Efficiency and Cost Management

**User Story:** As a project lead with budget constraints, I want the system to operate using free resources and open-source tools, so that I can deploy it without ongoing costs or credit card requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL utilize GitHub/GitLab free tier for repository management
2. WHEN data storage is needed THEN the system SHALL use SQLite or other free database solutions
3. WHEN security monitoring is required THEN the system SHALL use open-source monitoring tools
4. WHEN external services are needed THEN the system SHALL prioritize free alternatives over paid services
5. IF paid services are absolutely necessary THEN the system SHALL clearly document alternatives and provide warnings
