# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical backend debugging and compatibility issues in the DevGuard AI Copilot application. The primary focus is on fixing backend services, APIs, and database integrations that have multiple import errors, type mismatches, and interface incompatibilities. While the main effort is on backend fixes, we must ensure these changes maintain compatibility with existing frontend components and establish proper communication channels between backend and frontend layers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want all backend API services to compile and run without errors, so that the core application infrastructure is stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend API services are imported THEN all dependencies SHALL resolve correctly without missing file errors
2. WHEN backend services are instantiated THEN all required database services SHALL be available and functional
3. WHEN backend API methods are called THEN they SHALL return properly typed responses with consistent interfaces
4. WHEN the backend application starts THEN no import, compilation, or runtime errors SHALL occur
5. WHEN backend services interact with each other THEN they SHALL use compatible data types and method signatures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want unified API response types and interfaces across all backend services, so that the system has consistent data flow and frontend integration points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN different backend API services return responses THEN they SHALL use a single, shared APIResponse type definition
2. WHEN API responses are created THEN they SHALL have consistent structure, typing, and serialization methods
3. WHEN backend services communicate internally THEN they SHALL use compatible data models and interfaces
4. WHEN errors occur in backend services THEN they SHALL be returned in a standardized format with proper error codes
5. WHEN frontend components consume backend APIs THEN they SHALL receive predictable data formats without type conflicts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want all missing database services to be properly implemented and integrated, so that backend data operations work seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database services are imported THEN they SHALL exist with complete implementations and proper error handling
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL use consistent interfaces and return standardized results
3. WHEN audit logging is required THEN the AuditLogService SHALL be fully functional with proper database integration
4. WHEN user operations are performed THEN the UserService SHALL handle CRUD operations with proper validation
5. WHEN task operations are performed THEN the TaskService SHALL integrate with the existing Task model and database schema
6. WHEN services need to interact THEN they SHALL use proper dependency injection and service discovery patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want GitHub integration services to be properly implemented and debugged, so that repository operations work correctly in the backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub service methods are called THEN they SHALL use correct parameter signatures matching the actual implementation
2. WHEN GitHub API calls are made THEN they SHALL handle authentication, rate limiting, and error responses properly
3. WHEN GitHub operations complete THEN they SHALL return properly typed results compatible with backend API responses
4. WHEN GitHub service is instantiated THEN it SHALL use the correct singleton constructor pattern
5. WHEN backend APIs call GitHub services THEN they SHALL handle the responses without type conversion errors
6. WHEN GitHub integration fails THEN it SHALL provide meaningful error messages to backend API consumers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a full-stack developer, I want the fixed backend services to maintain compatibility with existing frontend components, so that the complete application stack functions without breaking changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend components call backend APIs THEN they SHALL receive expected response formats without requiring frontend code changes
2. WHEN data models are shared between frontend and backend THEN they SHALL have consistent definitions and serialization
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the backend auth service SHALL provide compatible tokens and user data for frontend consumption
4. WHEN real-time updates are needed THEN the backend WebSocket service SHALL broadcast properly formatted messages to frontend components
5. WHEN backend services are modified THEN existing frontend integration points SHALL continue to work without modification
6. WHEN new backend functionality is added THEN it SHALL follow established patterns that frontend components can easily consume
