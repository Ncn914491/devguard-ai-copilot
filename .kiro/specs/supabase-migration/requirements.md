# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the entire backend architecture from local SQLite database to Supabase (PostgreSQL) with integrated authentication, real-time capabilities, and cloud storage. The migration will replace all local database services, authentication mechanisms, and data models with Supabase equivalents while maintaining existing functionality and improving scalability, security, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate from SQLite to Supabase PostgreSQL, so that the application can scale better and support real-time collaboration across multiple users and devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize Supabase client instead of SQLite database
2. WHEN any database operation is performed THEN the system SHALL use Supabase queries instead of SQLite queries
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing data models SHALL be preserved in PostgreSQL format
4. WHEN the system performs CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL use supabase.from('<table>') methods instead of SQLite queries
5. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL use SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY from environment configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using Supabase Auth with email/password and GitHub OAuth, so that I can securely access the application with modern authentication methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to log in with email/password THEN the system SHALL use supabase.auth.signInWithPassword() instead of local authentication
2. WHEN a user attempts GitHub OAuth login THEN the system SHALL use supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth() with GitHub provider
3. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL use supabase.auth.signUp() to create the account
4. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL use supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()
5. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL listen to supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange() for session management
6. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL use supabase.auth.signOut() to clear the session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all data models to be migrated to Supabase PostgreSQL tables, so that data persistence works seamlessly with the new backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs to store team members THEN it SHALL use a PostgreSQL table with proper schema and constraints
2. WHEN the system needs to store tasks THEN it SHALL use a PostgreSQL table with foreign key relationships to team members
3. WHEN the system needs to store security alerts THEN it SHALL use a PostgreSQL table with proper indexing for performance
4. WHEN the system needs to store audit logs THEN it SHALL use a PostgreSQL table with timestamp indexing
5. WHEN the system needs to store deployments THEN it SHALL use a PostgreSQL table with environment and status tracking
6. WHEN the system needs to store snapshots THEN it SHALL use a PostgreSQL table with git commit references
7. WHEN the system needs to store specifications THEN it SHALL use a PostgreSQL table with approval workflow support

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want Row-Level Security (RLS) implemented in Supabase, so that users can only access data they are authorized to see based on their role and permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RLS policies are created THEN they SHALL enforce role-based access control for all tables
2. WHEN an admin user accesses data THEN they SHALL have full access to all records
3. WHEN a lead developer accesses data THEN they SHALL have access to team-related records and assigned projects
4. WHEN a developer accesses data THEN they SHALL only access records assigned to them or public records
5. WHEN a viewer accesses data THEN they SHALL only access read-only public records
6. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want file storage capabilities through Supabase Storage, so that I can upload and manage project-related files securely in the cloud.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs file storage THEN it SHALL use Supabase Storage buckets instead of local file system
2. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN it SHALL be stored in a project-specific bucket with proper access controls
3. WHEN a user downloads a file THEN the system SHALL verify permissions before providing access
4. WHEN files are organized THEN they SHALL be structured by project and user permissions
5. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and user feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment configuration updated for Supabase, so that the application can connect to the correct Supabase instance across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL read SUPABASE_URL from environment configuration
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL read SUPABASE_ANON_KEY from environment configuration
3. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL use development Supabase instance
4. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL use production Supabase instance
5. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fail gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive testing for Supabase integration, so that I can ensure all functionality works correctly with the new backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests run THEN they SHALL use Supabase test instance or proper mocking
2. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL test end-to-end workflows with Supabase
3. WHEN authentication tests run THEN they SHALL verify both email/password and OAuth flows
4. WHEN database tests run THEN they SHALL verify CRUD operations work correctly
5. WHEN the test suite completes THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive coverage of Supabase functionality

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the UI to handle Supabase-specific states and errors, so that I receive appropriate feedback during authentication and data operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the UI SHALL show loading states
2. WHEN Supabase API calls fail THEN the UI SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the UI SHALL provide offline state indicators
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the UI SHALL update immediately to reflect the new state
5. WHEN real-time updates are received THEN the UI SHALL update automatically without user intervention

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the deployment process updated for Supabase, so that the application can be deployed consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL connect to the appropriate Supabase instance for that environment
2. WHEN database migrations are needed THEN they SHALL be applied through Supabase migration system
3. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN they SHALL include all necessary Supabase credentials
4. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the system SHALL verify Supabase connectivity and functionality
5. WHEN rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL support reverting to previous Supabase state

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want real-time capabilities enabled through Supabase, so that users can collaborate in real-time and see live updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data changes in the database THEN subscribed clients SHALL receive real-time updates
2. WHEN multiple users are working on the same project THEN they SHALL see each other's changes immediately
3. WHEN real-time subscriptions are established THEN they SHALL be properly managed and cleaned up
4. WHEN network interruptions occur THEN real-time subscriptions SHALL reconnect automatically
5. WHEN real-time updates are received THEN they SHALL be processed efficiently without blocking the UI
