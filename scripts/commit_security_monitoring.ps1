git commit -m "feat: Implement comprehensive security monitoring with AI-powered detection

Enhanced Security Detection:
* Honeytoken breach detection with immediate critical alerts
* Abnormal data export volume monitoring (baseline vs current)
* Configuration drift detection with change type analysis
* Login anomaly detection (floods, unusual sources, off-hours access)

AI-Powered Explanations:
* Gemini integration for contextual security alert explanations
* Severity-based recommendations and rollback suggestions
* Actionable security response guidance

Comprehensive Testing:
* Unit tests for all detection scenarios
* Integration tests with AI copilot system
* Rollback integration testing
* Evidence collection validation

Key Features:
* Real-time baseline monitoring and anomaly detection
* Critical/High/Medium/Low severity classification
* Automatic rollback suggestions for critical events
* Comprehensive audit logging with AI reasoning
* Integration with copilot for security response

Satisfies Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5"
